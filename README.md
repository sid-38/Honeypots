# Honeypots

Paper for the major project I did for my undergraduate at National Institute of Technology, Calicut. The project involved deploying two honeypots - Cowrie (low level honeypot) and HonSSH (high level honeypot) in order to evaluate and observe the attacks on SSH ports on the Internet. While Cowrie was deployed on a local system with port forwarding (which on hindsight might have been risky), HonSSH was deployed in Azure. Within around 15 minutes of the deployment, our unadvertised SSH port started facing attacks. We were able to gather statistical information such as username-password combinations, IP address from where the attack seemed to originate, its geographical location, etc using Cowrie. Using HonSSH we were able to gather some tools and scripts the attackers were running on the system after gaining access. Initial inference was that most of the tools and stratergies were to determine if the environment was a virtualized environment, which indicates that checking for such an environment is a common priliminary step for an attacker after he gains access to a system.
